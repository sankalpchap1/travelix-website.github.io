    "The Yelp dataset contains a vast amount of data, making the corresponding JSON files very large. To handle this big data, we developed a CSV parser that converts the JSON files into CSV format. The converted CSV files served as a starting point for our recommendation algorithms, allowing us to efficiently access the necessary data. In the implementation, we utilized the Pandas library to read and manipulate the data, allowing us to develop more complex algorithms to extract insights from the dataset. The utilization of CSV format and Pandas library helped us effectively manage and process the data, providing a more streamlined and efficient approach to analyzing the Yelp dataset.",

    "At Travelix, our recommendation system relied on three primary datasets: Business, Users, and Reviews. Due to the large size of these datasets, we employed a preprocessing step to divide the Business data by state. We identified the top ten states based on the highest number of businesses and used them for generating recommendations. Further categorization of the Business data was carried out to focus on the three main categories of interest: Hotels & Travel, Restaurants, and Nightlife. This enabled us to create more focused and relevant recommendations for our users based on their interests and preferences. Some of the subcategories are as follows",
